🧼 Lavandera Luxe — Laundry Service Website (Sample Project)

This is a fictional laundry service website I designed as part of my ongoing web development practice.
It's a static, fully responsive one-page website created to reflect the branding, services, and professionalism of a modern laundry business.

🧠 About the Project

This project was created to simulate the kind of website a real laundry service might need 
— simple, clean, and focused on helping customers quickly understand what the business offers. 
It also allowed me to refine my skills in layout design, visual hierarchy, and responsive development.
